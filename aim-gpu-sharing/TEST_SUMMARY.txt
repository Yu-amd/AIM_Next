GPU Sharing Test Results - Summary
===================================

✅ Option 1: Docker GPU Sharing - WORKS
   - Two Docker containers can share the same GPU
   - Both containers running and serving models
   - Both processes visible in amd-smi
   - Memory divided: ~43GB + ~14GB = ~57GB total
   - Both endpoints responding

❌ Option 2: CPX Mode - NOT AVAILABLE
   - Hardware only supports SPX/NPS1 mode
   - Cannot create 8 partitions
   - Digital Ocean MI300X limitation

❌ Option 3: Multi-Container Pod - DOESN'T WORK
   - Pod cannot be scheduled in Kubernetes
   - Error: Insufficient amd.com/gpu
   - AMD GPU operator enforces exclusive allocation

RECOMMENDATION: Use Docker for GPU sharing validation
